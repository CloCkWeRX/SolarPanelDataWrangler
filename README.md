# SolarPanelDataWrangler

This is a small project containing scripts I'm using to manipulate data having to do with finding solar panels with machine learning and adding their locations to OpenStreetMap

# Instructions

If you don't want to query the data yourself (and have to manually fix it yourself) simply unzip geoJSON.zip in place.

# Contributing

Feel free to submit pull requests if you want to add a feature or optimize the code! I'm also down to add other Open Climate Fix collaborators as collaborators on this repo. (Especially as I'll be out of country on vaction 3/16-3/23)
