# SolarPanelDataWrangler

This is a small project containing scripts I'm using to manipulate data having to do with finding solar panels with machine learning and adding their locations to OpenStreetMap

# Instructions

If you don't want to query the data yourself (and have to manually fix it yourself) simply unzip geoJSON.zip in place.
